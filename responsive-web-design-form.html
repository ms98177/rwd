    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <h2>Solving today's Web challenges</h2>
    <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) solve many challenges that Web developers
      face today. People now access the Web using many devices, some that did
      not exist when many websites were first created. Because of this, some
      sites do not resolve as intended or even effectively to be usefull for all
      viewers. Search engines now require or reward sites that are accessible to
      all viewers. Designing sites that present a specific view on each device is
      difficult or even impossible. As technology changes, it may impossible
      to predict how, who, or even what may view today's sites in the future.
      Because of this, sites must be coded to provide a baseline experience for
      all users, starting with devices that use the smallest of screens: mobile
      devices. In order to achieve this goal, elements of RWD should be employed,
      such as fluid grid that allows proportional/relative sizing, appropriate
      sized images, and media queries to serve CSS based on device attributes.
